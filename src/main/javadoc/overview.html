  <p>Circe is a hash algorithm framework that supports pluggable hash
    implementations discovered at runtime. Its primary goal is to enable the
    usage of high-performance native-code and hardware-accelerated hash
    algorithms, while also providing pure Java implementations when native
    libraries or hardware acceleration are not available.</p>
  <p>Circe provides hash functions in both stateful and stateless forms. The
    stateful form accumulates state internally from potentially multiple input
    segments and provides access to the output as various primitive types and
    byte arrays. The stateless form is available when the output can be
    represented by an {@code int} or a {@code long} and provides the output
    immediately for a given input. Additionally, for algorithms like CRC where
    the state and output are essentially interchangeable, an incremental
    stateless form is provided that allows more data to be hashed using the
    output from hashing a previous segment. To facilitate access from native
    code, all hash interfaces accept input from direct (and non-direct) {@link
    java.nio.ByteBuffer} objects and (unsafe) {@code long} memory addresses, in
    addition to Java byte arrays.</p>
